Creating a simple solution to a complex problem help us to take away the stress and uncertainty that is part of our life as IT professionals.

Simplicity is **not** Simplistic. Simplistic is about treating complex problems as if they were simples than they really are. Simplicity is about acknowledging the complexity of the problem and creat a nimble, fast, scalable solution that will solve that issue.

No matter if it is creating a solution from scratch or refactoring an existing one, the most important principle of Simplicity is to do as little as possible to efficiently solve the problem, having always in mind that the solution can grow as the business grows.
